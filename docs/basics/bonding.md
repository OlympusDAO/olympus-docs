# Bonds

Olympus bonds are a financial primitive that allow transacting assets,often between a protocol and individual stakeholders,over a specified time-period and at completely market-driven prices. In other words, Olympus bonds are a market-driven pricing mechanism for any two ERC-20 tokens that does not rely on third parties like oracles.

Reserve Bonds are an application of this primitive, which sells OHM at a discount to acquire Treasury assets. External Bonds represent the primary mechanism for Olympus Treasury inflows.

When purchasing a bond, purchasers commit a capital sum upfront in return for OHM upon maturity. Thus, a bond’s profit is uncertain and dependent on the price of OHM at the time of maturity. 

When viewing a current bond offering, a positive discount indicates that the bond is currently offering OHM at a discount to its current market price. A negative discount indicates that the bond is currently offering OHM at a premium to its current market price. 

This variable discount rate is how a bond market internally governs its supply by responding to demand. This ensures that a bond market’s supply is sold over the specified period of time.
