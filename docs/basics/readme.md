# Introduction

## What is Olympus?

Olympus is a distributed protocol on the Ethereum blockchain with the goal of establishing OHM as a reserve currency of DeFi. It operates thanks to its autonomous and dynamic monetary policy, with market operations supported by the Olympus Treasury as a core component of the protocol. 

What are reserve currencies designed to achieve?
Preserving purchasing power: Over the medium- to long-term the asset grows to out-pace inflation, and becomes more stable over time
Deep liquidity: Reserve currencies are highly liquid and can be easily exchanged for other assets, products and services
Utilized as a unit of account: Other assets are denominated in the currency


Olympus DAO’s efforts in Treasury management, development of on-chain governance structures and prudent use of Olympus’ liquidity and Treasury assets will help to strengthen OHM’s stability to usher in the growth of the Olympus blockchain network economy.
