# Staking

Olympus leverages the staking mechanism to organize the capital within the network ($OHM) around economic activity which is productive for both the protocol treasury and OHM holders, with the Olympus Treasury being one of the largest OHM holders.

Olympus is able to, either directly or indirectly, incentivize different modes of economic activity that help manage risk to the protocol and treasury as a part of its evolving and autonomous monetary policy.

***Base Staking Rate [TBD?]***

Base Staking Rate functions as a base incentive to hold OHM, helps to drive demand, and acts as a reference rate for emerging lending markets. Furthermore, it acts as a foundation for OHM bonds to develop a yield curve across different expiries.
