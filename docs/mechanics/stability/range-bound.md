# Range Bound Stability

After the protocol was able to bootstrap its treasury with an initial growth phase powered by the continuous emission of bonds, it has reached a treasury size and an overall maturity where it can start shifting its focus towards a more stable phase.

Having this in mind, Zeus (with the support of the DAO members) ideated a novel mechanism that leverages the protocol treasury reserves and protocol owner liquidity to create an algorithmic forward-looking trading range in which the protocol provides a spread of maker and taker bids and asks to create consistent, predictable market pricing. This system moderates protocol and treasury growth in exchange for support, effectively making the treasury an active participant of the ecosystem that backs its currency.

A deep-dive explanation of the system can be found in the [Range Bound Stability paper](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vSIufbgAxAAtZkITd_s57o5AmyhAnk6iYbLYvN-ATL59hQ5nC2t2BTPvA8X9DYzFa-i3PRw9ARrAS9E/pub).


## How will the Range Bound system help with Stability?

By evolving from a passive liquidity provider role, into a more active one with market making activity and by defining a framework, a set of objectives, and clearly communicating the Treasury operations in advance, the protocol reduces market risk for its participants through the issuance of guidance and by providing predictability.

As long as the protocol remains credible and trustworthy, the market participants are incentivized to support the objectives that the protocol sets (predictability), so those that trade alongside the Treasury are rewarded and those deviating are dissuaded.

The credibility of this protocol guidance is derived from the capitalization of the Treasury and its monopoly on market liquidity. As long as the Treasury holds significant assets relative to the *market capitalization of the liquid supply of OHM*, the market should take its guidance seriously. On top of that, the protocolâ€™s ownership of the entire liquidity market further extends this dynamic.

*Note that the influence of the Treasury over the market is directly dependent of the liquid supply of OHM. Thanks to the introduction of [OHM bonds](./ohm-bonds.md), the the protocol can convert current supply into supply locked on a protocol level, magnifying the influence of the Treasury over the liquid market.*
