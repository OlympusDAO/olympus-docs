# Policy Team & Policy Framework

The policy team is composed of about 10 members of the Olympus community who have displayed sufficient knowledge of the protocol and a curiosity to continue to learn as the protocol grows in size and complexity. Policy is largely guided by the [policy framework](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/622-oip-56-olympusdao-policy-framework-v2).

Policy closely monitors the behavior of the protocol and utilizes the powers assigned to them in the policy framework to actively manage the protocol. Policy is committed to help bring inflows into the treasury, to continue to increase OHM's relative backing, and help Olympus to continue developing products and services that grow the Olympus economy.
