# Council

All proposals, whether being consistent with the general direction of the DAO, a change in policy, or a pivot to a certain strategy or framework are voted for by the community. Any member of the community can create a proposal on the forum for discussion before being posted to snapshot for a governance vote. [Olympus Governance Council (OGC)](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1156-oip-91-olympus-governance-council) will be initially comprised of 7 veteran community members who are primarily responsible for facilitating off-chain processes. These can include, but are not limited to, establishing strategic vision, coordinating working groups to execute on community-approved initiatives, and proposing strategic initiatives to the community via OIP.

:::note
Key deliverables for the OGC include:

* Drive prioritization and alignment across the DAO departments and working groups
* Chart a path to further decentralized DAO governance and operations
