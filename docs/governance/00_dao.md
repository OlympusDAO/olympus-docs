# Governance & DAO

Olympus DAO is a network of dedicated community members who execute on decisions & protocol mechanisms voted on through community governance.

The DAO is pursuing a strategy of “progressive decentralization.” Currently, major components of the protocol are controlled at a high-level by the DAO. Though, ultimately the focus is on creating a foundation at the Treasury, Policy and economic levels, and to enable the community to directly operate protocol mechanics – in a trust- and process-minimized fashion.
