# Protocol Owned Liquidity

Olympus pioneered the concept of protocol owned liquidity, and the Olympus protocol has always owned a substantial amount of the OHM liquidity. This ensures users and protocols are always able to swap OHM, regardless of market conditions and external events.

The Olympus treasury keeps OHM liquidity on decentralized exchanges. With RBS the balance between reserves and liquidity is algorithmic, with the goal to optimize the liquidity depth and reserves for robustness and long term market stability.
