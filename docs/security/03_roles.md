## Understanding Roles

Olympus V3 uses the [Default Framework](https://github.com/fullyallocated/Default) to configure the protocol’s smart contracts and authorized addresses within the system.

More information regarding Default Framework can be found in the [Contracts Overview section](../technical/00_overview.md) of the docs.

### Relevant Contracts
1. **Kernel.sol**
	- Contract registry that manages all the contracts of the system. The `Kernel` is in charge of module and policy upgradability.

	**Roles:**
	- `executor`: Only address that can interact with the `Kernel` contract. The `executor` can install and upgrade modules, as well as approve and terminate policies.

	**Roles:**
	- `admin`: Only address that can grant/revoke roles by calling `grantRole()` and `revokeRole()` respectively. It is also the only address that can propose a newAdmin by calling pushNewAdmin(). On top of that, the newAdmin must accept the role by calling pullNewAdmin().

	![](/gitbook/assets/security-diagrams/olympus-roles.svg)

	- `MINTR.activate`

	**Roles:**
	- `emergency_shutdown`: has the ability to shutdown Treasury withdrawals by calling `shutdownWithdrawals()`, Minting capabilities by calling `shutdownMinting()`, or both by calling `shutdown()`. This role is held by the Emergency Multisig, requiring only 2 confirmations out of 8 signers.
	- `emergency_restart`: has the ability to restart Treasury withdrawals by calling `restartWithdrawals()`, Minting capabilities by calling `restartMinting()`, or both by calling `restart()`. This role is held by the DAO Multisig, requiring 4 confirmations out of 8 signers.

Limited to the Policy Multisig contract.
	- `operator_operate`: Has the ability to make the system work. Executes different core functions depending on the system state. Limited to the `Heart` contract (triggered by keepers) and the DAO Multisig.
