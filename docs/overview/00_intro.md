# What is Olympus Protocol?

Olympus is a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain and supports OHM, a community-owned, decentralized and censorship-resistant reserve currency. OHM is deeply liquid and fully backed by stable assets. It conducts autonomous and dynamic monetary policy, with market operations supported by the protocol-owned Olympus Treasury.

OHM serves a need in the market gap between fiat stablecoins and volatile crypto assets, providing relative stability and scalability underpinned by the protocol’s Range Bound Stability (“RBS”) and Cooler Loans systems. RBS is the flagship system of Olympus’ autonomous monetary policy.
