# Treasury

The Treasury is a key component of the Olympus protocol. The Treasury represents all assets owned and controlled by the protocol.

The primary responsibility of the Treasury is to ensure OHM liquidity on open markets and stabilize OHM with direct market operations in certain situations. Secondarily, the treasury manages a set of strategic assets for the long term benefit of the protocol.

The main assets, reserves and OHM liquidity positions, are called protocol reserve assets and are held in the on-chain treasury contract. Protocol controlled assets are managed via secondary contracts (called allocators) and assets that cannot be managed via contracts are managed by the Olympus DAO via multisigs and are called DAO controlled assets.
