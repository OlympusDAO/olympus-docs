OHM is the native token of the Olympus protocol, and is fully-backed by the Olympus Treasury. Unlike other stablecoins, OHM is not pegged to any fiat currency. Instead, it is a free-floating "flatcoin" that programmatically and transparently enforces a price range using the Range Bound Stability (RBS) system. OHM aims to fill the gap between fiat stablecoins and volatile crypto assets, providing relative stability and scalability in a fully autonomous way with no off-chain dependencies.
